### Buttons

The buttons all have updated styles, but most of the basic buttons are still there.

- `DefaultAltButton` is deprecated. Use `DefaultButton` or `<DefaultButton alt>` instead. If you still want the shadows, use [box shadows](/css_utilities_box-shadows.html)
- `LowlightButton` -> `<DefaultButton flat>`
- `HighlightButton` ->  `PrimaryButton`
- `HighlightAltButton` is deprecated, just use `HighlightButton`. You can use `BrandButton` if you must.


### Dropdowns

There are no longer 7 dropdown components (`LinkDropdown`, `DefaultDropdown`, `HighlightDropdown`, etc). There is only `Dropdown`.
The `Dropdown` component takes many React props. To recreate the old `LinkDropdown`, you can use `<Dropdown flat link>` instead.
Most of the other old dropdown styles have been deprecated. There are basically only three launcher styles now: default, `flat`, and `split`.

### React Iconography

- Use the `src` prop instead of the `name` prop
- The `Icon` component will inline SVGs instead of using Font Awesome. Many of the icons may have different names and different layout properties.
- Webpack svg-react-loader is now required for iconography
- Icons no longer take the `size` prop. Instead, they are sized based on the local font size.
If you want an icon with a different size, you can change the font size for that icon, or provide a `style` prop with `width` and `height`

### CSS Iconography

If you are using iconography, but not using React, it will be more difficult to use. All of the SVGs are inside of the `pui-css-iconography` node module.
If you would like to use an icon, you can use the SVGs directly from the node module.
If you do not mind black icons, you can serve up the SVGs and use them inside of `img` tags.
If you need to color your icons, you need to copy the content of the SVG and put it directly into your html. CSS can then be used for colors.

### CSS Alerts

Alerts look the same, but the css has changed. You may need to add an extra div inside of a multi-line alert.
Also, the close button is no longer float: right, so it needs to be at the end of your alert html.

### General

There are more breaking changes than usual in this release, it is possible we missed something. Please file issues on github or ask questions on the pivotal-ui slack channel.

The goals for the 6.0 release are:

- Remove React Bootstrap Dependency
  - This should make it much easier for teams to choose their version of React without causing dependency conflicts.
  - This will also make it easier in the future to use non-Bootstrap designs.
- Add a couple new React Components

- Alert: The `dismissable` prop is now just a boolean. If you want a function that is called on dismissal, use the `onDimiss` prop.
- Modals: The `bsSize` prop has been renamed to `size`.
- React Bootstrap: Alerts, Grids, Modals and Tabs are now entirely different code paths. The goal was to replace all old functionality, but undocumented behavior may have changed.

### Typography

pui-react-typography is no longer supported.
Replace `<DefaultH2>`, `<AlternateH2>` or `<MarketingH2>` with `<h2>`.
The headers will now be less bold. This is intended by the designers.
If your application wants headers to be bigger and bolder, add CSS in your own application.

### Renames

- `<BasicInput>` becomes `<Input>`
- `<SearchInput>` becomes `<Input search>`
- `<SimpleTabs>` becomes `<Tabs>`
- `<SimpleTabsAlt>` becomes `<Tabs tabType="simple-alt">`
- `<SortableTable>` becomes `<Table>`
- `<OverlayTrigger trigger={['hover']}>` becomes `<OverlayTrigger trigger="hover">`
- Use `TileLayoutItem` instead of `TileLayout.Item`
- Look for `RadioGroup` in `pui-react-radio`

### Other changes

- Stop using the `fancy-select` CSS class, just use regular selects.
If you want a fancy chooser, consider dropdowns.
- Provide a class to Input with the `inputClassName` prop instead of `className`.
- DropdownItem no longer automatically wraps content in an `a` tag unless an `href` prop is provided.
- The markup generated by tooltips is different. The classes are prefixed with 'pui-', like 'pui-tooltip'.

### CSS Compiling

We would like to deprecate Dr Frankenstyle due to its performance issues and maintenance cost.
In PUI 4.0, you can use Webpack loaders instead.
The combination of `css-loader`, `file-loader` and `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
recreates the functionality of Dr Frankenstyle in much less time.

See the [Webpack Config](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/react-starter/blob/master/config/webpack.config.js) in React Starter.
In React Starter `NODE_ENV=production gulp assets` will output a `components.css` file
in addition to any fonts and images needed by that CSS into `public`.
