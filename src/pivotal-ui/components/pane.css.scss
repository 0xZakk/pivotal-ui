Panes are horizontal groupings of content that are usually used to
span the full browser window width. It's going to look funny here,
a better way to view it is on the [panes page](/pane.html).

You can combine up to two background classes on the pane component.
The one on the `.pane` element will span the full browser width. The
one on the `.container` element will be constrained to the content width.

```html_example
<div class="pane bg-dark-1">
  <div class="container bg-glow">
    <h1 class="type-neutral-11">This is a pane</h1>
  </div>
</div>

```
