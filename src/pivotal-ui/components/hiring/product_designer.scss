<h1 class="h1 em-high type-dark-1 txt-c title mbxxl">Product Designer</h1>
<h2 class="h2 type-dark-2">
  The Pivotal Cloud Foundry team is looking for great Product Designers to join us in San Francisco and New York. Join a team of like-minded designers in the Bay Area or Manhattan that work at Pivotal. We pair together, critique work together and share ideas and process and methodology. We believe in working at a sustainable pace – you’ll typically work hard for 8 hours each day, but then you’re off work to relax, recharge, and refocus. We also stock beef jerky and vegan beef jerky if that's your thing.
