Images can be made responsive-friendly via the addition of the `.img-responsive` class. This applies `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` to the image so that it scales nicely to the parent element. See bootstrap 3 for further documentation of this feature.

```haml_example
.row
  .col-md-5
    %img.img-responsive{:alt => "Responsive image", :src => "http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/581/296/c09.jpg"}
  .col-md-7
    %img.img-responsive{:alt => "Responsive image", :src => "http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/581/296/c09.jpg"}
  .col-md-12
    %img.img-responsive{:alt => "Responsive image", :src => "http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/581/296/c09.jpg"}
```
